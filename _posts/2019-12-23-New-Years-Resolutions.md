Life is pushing forward so strong year by year. I've just clone this repo in order to do something but it's still unclear.

So, for now, I would be satisfied if I kept this website active. The goal might be related in some degree to keep tech-things going.

A new paper, a new track mark, enhance german learning ... That's my new-not-easy-but-affordables goals.
What I should propose to myself?
